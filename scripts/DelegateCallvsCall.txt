Delegate calls are used to call the functionality of the logic contract but have the changes reflected in the context
 of the calling contract. It essentially behaves as if you imported the functionality of the logic contract into the 
 calling contract and the changes are reflected in the context of the calling contract. This behaves much like importing
  libraries when you are coding large projects and using that functionality as if it were part of your project.

Vs

The regular call acts more like a remote API where we are making changes on the remote logic contract rather than our
 calling contract. When using a regular call, we are calling the logic contract but the effects of that are retained 
 within the logic contract. Rather than in the context of the calling contract.
